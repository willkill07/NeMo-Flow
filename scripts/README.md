# Scripts

The canonical build and test surface now lives in the repository `justfile`.
Use `just --list` to discover supported developer workflows.

Keep `scripts/` focused on helpers that are still script-native:

## Top-Level Commands

- `build-docs.sh`: compatibility wrapper around the Fern documentation validation recipe; it regenerates ignored Fern API reference pages before checking the site
- `generate_attributions.sh`: regenerate attribution documents
- `test-install.sh`: Run live GitHub release and local interface checks for the curl-based CLI installer
- `test-install.ps1`: Run live GitHub release and local interface checks for the PowerShell CLI installer
- `test-install-mocks.sh`: Run installer scenarios that require simulated platforms or failures

## Opt-In Coding-Agent E2E Tests

These checks exercise installed coding-agent clients and are intentionally outside the default Rust and CI test suites. Run the recipe that matches an available local client:

- `just test-codex-plugin-e2e`
- `just test-claude-plugin-e2e`
- `NEMO_RELAY_CLAUDE_DESKTOP_LIVE_POC=1 just test-claude-desktop-live-poc` (installs user TLS trust and a login service, consumes real subscription requests, and pauses for GUI confirmation)
- `just test-hermes-mcp-e2e`

## Internal Layout

- `docs/`: Fern reference-generation, migration cleanup, and `docs-website` branch sync helpers. Generated API reference output under `docs/reference/api/*-library-reference/` is ignored and recreated by `just docs`.
- `licensing/`: attribution generation helpers, including license inventory diff scripts
- `lint/`: pre-commit and local lint helpers
- `test-support/`: shared test utilities
